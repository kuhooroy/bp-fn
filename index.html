    <h3>NYC Clean Heat program (HC 3):</h3>
    <p>The NYC Clean Heat Program was implemented to make NYC more energy efficient by helping New Yorkers transition from previous traditional methods of heating and cooling to cleaner heating fuels. The program encourages a switch to cold climate air source heat pumps (ASHP, extract heat from the air outside and distribute it inside your home), energy efficient ground source heat pumps (GSHP, pull heat out of the ground through an underground pipe system and then distribute it through the building), and heat pump water heaters (HPWH, use electricity to pull heat out of the air and direct it into water enclosed in a tank). The key contributors to the issue at hand are No. 4 fuel, “distillate fuel made by blending distillate fuel oil and residual fuel oil stocks” that is used often in industrial plants and commercial burner installations that don’t have preheating facilities, and No. 6 fuel, a dense oil made by blending heavy residual oils with a lighter oil that is used for the production of electric power, space heating, vessel bunkering, and various industrial purposes. The NYC Department of Environmental Protection's Boiler Registration program carefully monitors boilers to reduce soot emissions and ensure they are up to operational standards using the Clean Air Tracking System (CATS). It requires buildings to register any boilers that output more than 350,000 BTUs but less than 2.8 million BTUs. Additionally, the Greener Greener Buildings Plan (GGBP) is a comprehensive set of energy efficiency laws targeting New York City’s largest existing buildings, aiming to reduce our carbon footprint and save customers $700 million in annual energy costs. For example, Law 84 requires building owners to assess their energy and water usage every year and report this information to the Environmental Protection Agency, and Law 87 requires all buildings that are over 50,000 square feet to get an energy audit and retro-commission every ten years. The Clean Heat program provides resources to building owners to help them make the transition, and the city continues to implement incentives, such as a hard deadline, that encourage businesses and homeowners to switch to clean heating.</p>
    <h3>NYC Emissions (HC 4):</h3>
    <p>A main contributor to New York City’s greenhouse gas emissions is its buildings, whose emissions mainly come from housing and food-related consumption, each of which produced around 7 metric tons of CO2 emissions per household in 2019. The total carbon emissions for 22,852 properties in NYC as a whole this year is 17,738,124 metric tons of CO2 (primarily from natural gas), of which 5,119,577 metric tons comes from the 4,377 properties in the Bronx, meaning the Bronx contributes to approximately 29% of the whole city’s carbon emissions. According to NYC EcoDataLab’s “Consumption-Based Emissions Map,” the Bronx seems to have relatively low emissions throughout, generally staying below 29 MTCO2e per household, and below 12 MTCO2e per person, whereas the rest of the city produce up to 60 MTCO2e per household and 28 MTCO2e per person. 49% percent of a household’s housing emissions comes from natural gas, and 19% comes from electricity. Furnishings and appliances contribute to 37% of a household’s goods emissions. The Bronx typically had lower emissions compared to the rest of the NYC boroughs and NYC as a whole, transportation contributing 2.5 MTCO2e per household, 6.0 housing, 6.9 food, 3.6 goods, and 4.9 services, the total per household emissions being 24 MTCO2 and the total per capita emissions 9. On the other hand, NYC as a whole on average contributed 4.1 MTCO2e per household, 7.0 housing, 7.5 food, 4.2 goods, and 5.9 services, the total per household emissions being 29 MTCO2 and the total per capita emissions 11. In 2019, the Climate Mobilization Act was set which limited emissions from buildings over 25,000 square feet, and required solar and green roofs for new buildings. This is predicted to reduce emissions from the biggest buildings by 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050.</p>
