    <h1>Clean Heat Analysis: Bronx</h1>
    <h2>By: Sreejita Roy and Adrijana Mehmedovic</h2>

    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p>Throughout the course of this semester we have particularly focused on two neighborhoods in the Bronx, Soundview and Bedford Park-Fordham North. We have analyzed their  demographics, housing, and energy usage patterns, while exploring different sustainability projects in New York City.</p>
    <h4>Demographics:</h4>
    <p>Soundview, Bronx:<br><br>
      Population: 66,730<br>
      Predominantly Hispanic 60.4%<br>
      with a median age of 32.9 years.
    </p>
    <p>Bedford Park, Bronx:<br>
    Population: 32,120<br>
    Predominantly Hispanic 64.1%<br>
    with a median age of 32 years.
    </p>
    <p>Fordham North, Bronx<br>
    Population: 73,395<br>
    Predominantly Hispanic 73%<br>
    with a median age of 30.8 years.
    </p>

    <h4>Background:</h4>
    <p>The NYC Clean Heat Program is an intiative to make the city more energy efficient. It encourages and helps New York buildings to transition to cleaner heating methods,
      such as cold climate air source heat pumps, energy efficient ground source heat pumps, and heat pump water heaters. The key villains in our city's crisis are No. 4 and No. 6 fuels.
      Some of the city's supporting initiatives include the NYC DEP's Boiler Registration Program, which requires buildings to register any boilers that output more than 350,000 BTUs but less than 2.8 million BTUs,
      and the Greener Greater Buildings Plan, which is a comprehensive set of energy efficiency laws that targets New York Cityâ€™s largest existing buildings and requires them to do things like
      assess and report their energy and water usage every year and regulate the energy-efficiency of their designs. The Clean Heat Program and NYC are continuously providing resources and incentives
      to make the transition more accessible and efficient for everyone.
