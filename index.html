    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p>Throughout the course of this semester we have particularly focused on two neighborhoods in the Bronx: Soundview and Bedford Park-Fordham North. We have analyzed their  demographics, housing, and energy usage patterns, while exploring different sustainability projects in New York City.</p>

    <h4>Background:</h4>
    <p>The NYC Clean Heat Program is an intiative to make the city more energy efficient. It encourages and helps New York buildings to transition to cleaner heating methods,
      such as cold climate air source heat pumps, energy efficient ground source heat pumps, and heat pump water heaters. The key villains in our city's crisis are No. 4 and No. 6 fuels.
      Some of the city's supporting initiatives include the NYC DEP's Boiler Registration Program, which requires buildings to register any boilers that output more than 350,000 BTUs but less than 2.8 million BTUs,
      and the Greener Greater Buildings Plan, which is a comprehensive set of energy efficiency laws that targets New York City’s largest existing buildings and requires them to do things like
      assess and report their energy and water usage every year and regulate the energy-efficiency of their designs. The Clean Heat Program and NYC are continuously providing resources and incentives
      to make the transition more accessible and efficient for everyone.    
    </p>

    <h4>Findings:</h4>
    <p>Through our data analysis, we have discovered that the Bronx is typically more energy efficient than the rest of the city's boroughs. For example, when we graphed the Boiler Capacity vs. Total Gallons (High)
      for each of the boroughs, we noticed that the majority of the Bronx's boilers have a relatively small capacity, not surpassing 20 BTU and 1,000,000 gallons. Furthermore, we found that the Bronx had the highest
      ratio of No. 4 to No. 6 fuel users. Since No. 4 fuel is the lesser of the two evils due to it not needing to be preheated, the Bronx is the most energy efficient borough in this regard. We also discovered that
      the Bronx hosts the majority of all of NYC's walk-up apartments, so it expends less energy toward technology like elevators. When we looked deeper within our respective neighborhoods, we found more evidence that
      supports the claim that the Bronx and its neighborhoods are relatively more energy efficient than the rest of the city.
