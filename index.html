    <h3>NYC Clean Heat program (HC 3):</h3>
    <p>The NYC Clean Heat Program was implemented to make NYC more energy efficient by helping New Yorkers transition from previous traditional methods of heating and cooling to cleaner heating fuels. The program encourages a switch to cold climate air source heat pumps (ASHP, extract heat from the air outside and distribute it inside your home), energy efficient ground source heat pumps (GSHP, pull heat out of the ground through an underground pipe system and then distribute it through the building), and heat pump water heaters (HPWH, use electricity to pull heat out of the air and direct it into water enclosed in a tank). The key contributors to the issue at hand are No. 4 fuel, “distillate fuel made by blending distillate fuel oil and residual fuel oil stocks” that is used often in industrial plants and commercial burner installations that don’t have preheating facilities, and No. 6 fuel, a dense oil made by blending heavy residual oils with a lighter oil that is used for the production of electric power, space heating, vessel bunkering, and various industrial purposes. The NYC Department of Environmental Protection's Boiler Registration program carefully monitors boilers to reduce soot emissions and ensure they are up to operational standards using the Clean Air Tracking System (CATS). It requires buildings to register any boilers that output more than 350,000 BTUs but less than 2.8 million BTUs. Additionally, the Greener Greener Buildings Plan (GGBP) is a comprehensive set of energy efficiency laws targeting New York City’s largest existing buildings, aiming to reduce our carbon footprint and save customers $700 million in annual energy costs. For example, Law 84 requires building owners to assess their energy and water usage every year and report this information to the Environmental Protection Agency, and Law 87 requires all buildings that are over 50,000 square feet to get an energy audit and retro-commission every ten years. The Clean Heat program provides resources to building owners to help them make the transition, and the city continues to implement incentives, such as a hard deadline, that encourage businesses and homeowners to switch to clean heating.</p>
