        <h3>Findings and Initiatives</h3>
        <p>Soundview is a 1.08-square-mile neighborhood in southeast Bronx, New York, with a population of 66,730 and a median age of 32.9. The population is 60.44% Hispanic, 24.38% Black, 8.48% Asian, 2.57% White, and 4.13% other. The median household income is $36,730, with an income per capita of $19,116. Households average three members, and there are 21,876 households, with 41.91% married, 34.35% led by female heads, 11.6% by male heads, and 12.13% non-family.The neighborhood has 23,962 housing units, 91.29% occupied and 8.71% vacant, with a median home value of $550,300 and median rent of $1,312. Most residents rent their homes (84.59%), while 15.41% own.</p>

        <p>The NYC Clean Heat program was put in effect March 1, 2024. It aims to transition buildings from inefficient fossil fuel heating methods like oil and natural gas to cleaner, more energy-efficient systems like air source heat pumps, ground source heat pumps, and heat pump water heaters. This program addresses the pollution caused by heavy fuels like No. 4 and No. 6 oil, which contribute to soot emissions in the city. Additionally, the Greener Greener Buildings Plan was introduced to reduce New York City's carbon footprint, particularly in large buildings, which account for 75% of the city's greenhouse gas emissions. Through various laws set in place, building owners are required to conduct energy assessments, retrofit systems, and upgrade to cleaner technologies. The Clean Heat Program offers help to building owners for this transition, including incentives and penalties for missing the deadline with fines of up to $10,000"</p>
        <p>Buildings are one of the top contributors to New York City's greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for around 80% of the city's total emissions, mainly due to them heavily relying on  fossil fuels for heating, cooling, and other everyday needs like cooking. In 2019, heating and cooling systems in commercial and large residential buildings created a significant amount of emissions, with the Bronx contributing about 29% of the city's total emissions. The majority of these emissions come from burning natural gas, electricity, and district steam. NYC aims to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050, with a focus on improving building energy efficiency. The Climate Mobilization Act, which was passed in 2019, targets buildings over 25,000 square feet, requiring them to get solar and green roofs, and switch to electric heat pumps. Using incentives and mandating energy usage reports, the city is working to reduce emissions from buildings, a key part in meeting climate goals.</p>

        <p>The bar plot below represents fuel #4 and #6 fractions by borough. Each borough uses more #4 fuel than #6 with the Bronx at the highest. Queens, followed by Staten Island lead in consumption of #6 fuel. </p>

        <p>The Pie Chart that follows separates total MMBTU(high) contribution by borough. Manhattan contributes the most MMBTU with over half (58.4%) and Staten Island contributes the least at 0.3%. Bronx contributes 26.8%.</p>
        <img src="hist.png" width="650" height="600">
        <p>The final plot histogram represents Soundviewâ€™s distribution of total MMBTU. The Total MMBTU (High) typically stays within a range of 2000 and 6000 MMBTU, peaking at 3000 MMBTU, which is less than the Bronx's overall mean, further proving that Soundview is relatively energy efficient</p>
